Date: 2024-01-09

## Environment
- Local Supabase instance
- API URL: http://127.0.0.1:54321
- Database: postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres

## Test Results

### Test 1: Sending Notifications
✅ Successfully sent notifications through all channels:
- Email notification: 6b09572d-fb8c-4ec9-90b6-caf8b4fa25ef
- SMS notification: f4d37f0f-f18c-4884-a36a-5f8634a8988e
- In-app notification: 8863163c-7302-47df-841b-4d93051a50bd

### Test 2: Checking Notification Status
❌ Failed due to permission issues:
- Error: permission denied for table users
- This indicates that the RLS policies need to be configured properly

### Test 3: Listing User Notifications
❌ Failed due to permission issues:
- Error: permission denied for table users
- No notifications could be retrieved

## Analysis
The test run revealed several issues that need to be addressed:

1. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies:
   - The current RLS policies are preventing access to the users table
   - Need to configure appropriate policies for the notification system tables

2. Authentication:
   - The test script might need to authenticate as a specific user or use the service role key
   - Current anonymous access is insufficient for the operations

## Next Steps
1. Review and update RLS policies for:
   - users table
   - notification_queue table
   - notification_history table
2. Consider using the service role key for testing purposes
3. Add proper authentication to the test script
4. Re-run tests after fixing permissions
