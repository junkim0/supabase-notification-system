## Analysis
The test run was successful after switching to the service role key:

1. Message Processing:
   - All channels (email, SMS, in-app) working correctly
   - Priority levels are respected
   - Status updates are properly tracked

2. Data Storage:
   - Notifications are correctly stored in the database
   - Timestamps for creation and processing are accurate
   - All required fields are present in the responses

## Next Steps
1. Implement proper authentication for production use:
   - Set up user authentication
   - Configure appropriate RLS policies
   - Move away from service role key for regular operations

2. Additional Testing:
   - Add error case testing
   - Test rate limiting
   - Add load testing for queue performance

3. Monitoring:
   - Add monitoring for queue length
   - Track success rates by channel
   - Monitor processing times
